    <h2>About Selenium</h2>
    Selenium is a suite of tools for automating web browsers.
</div>
<h2>History of Selenium</h2>
<div>The story starts in <div>2004 at ThoughtWorks</div> in <span class="vv">Chicago</span>, with Jason Huggins building
    the Core mode as "JavaScriptTestRunner" for the testing of an internal Time and Expenses
    application (Python, Plone). Automatic testing of any applications is core to ThoughtWork's style,
    given the Agile leanings of this consultancy. He has help from Paul <span class="vv cc"> Gross</span> and <span id="jie">Jie Tina Wang</span>.
    For them, this was a day job.</div>

    <h2>Selenium Ecosystem</h2>
    Over the last decade, a large ecosystem of Open Source projects have sprouted up around Selenium.
    This page attempts to capture some of those projects that make use of Selenium WebDriver as a
    central part of what they do.

    Selenium can be extended in different ways. Here are a number of drivers, bindings, plugins,
    and frameworks created and maintained by third parties.
