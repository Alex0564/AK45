        The story starts in <div class="cc">2004 at ThoughtWorks in <span class="dd">Chicago</span>,</div> with Jason Huggins building
    the Core mode as "JavaScriptTestRunner" for the testing of an internal Time and Expenses application (Python, Plone).
    Automatic testing of any applications is core to ThoughtWork's style,
    given the Agile leanings of this consultancy. He has help from Paul Gross and Jie Tina Wang.
    For them, this was a day job.

    This page attempts to capture some of those projects that make use of <span class="dd">Selenium WebDriver</span> as a central part of what they do.

    <span class="vv cc">Selenium</span> can be extended in different ways. Here are a number of drivers,
